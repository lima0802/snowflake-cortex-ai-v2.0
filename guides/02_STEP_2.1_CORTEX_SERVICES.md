# Step 2.1: Implement Cortex Service Wrappers

**Phase:** 2 - Core Services Implementation  
**Goal:** Build Python wrappers for each Cortex service  
**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

---

## Overview

This step involves creating Python wrapper classes for all four Snowflake Cortex services:
1. Cortex Analyst (NL-to-SQL)
2. Cortex Complete (LLM generation)
3. Cortex Search (Vector search)
4. Cortex ML (Anomaly detection, forecasting)

## 🎯 Understanding All Cortex Functions

### Quick Comparison Table

| Service | Primary Function | Input | Output | Use Case |
|---------|-----------------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Cortex Analyst** | Natural Language → SQL → Data | Question | SQL + Real Data | "What were sales last month?" |
| **Cortex Complete** | Text Generation (LLM) | Prompt | Generated Text | "Write 3 email subject lines" |
| **Cortex Search** | Semantic Vector Search | Query | Similar Documents | "Find campaigns about summer" |
| **Cortex ML** | Time Series Prediction | Historical Data | Forecasts/Anomalies | "Predict next week's metrics" |

---

## 🤔 Should You Use Snowflake MCP Instead?

### What is Snowflake MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources. The Snowflake MCP server allows LLMs like Claude to query Snowflake databases directly.

---

### 💡 When MCP Would Be Better

Use **Snowflake MCP** if your project only needs:
- ✅ Simple SQL query execution
- ✅ Quick prototyping with Claude Desktop
- ✅ Read-only database access
- ✅ No orchestration or business logic
- ✅ Single-user or personal productivity tool

---

### 🏆 Why Orchestrator Architecture is Better for DIA

**1. Multiple Cortex Services Required**
```python
# DIA orchestrator intelligently routes:
if intent == "data_query":
    → Cortex Analyst (semantic model + SQL generation)
elif intent == "content_generation":
    → Cortex Complete (text generation)
elif intent == "search_campaigns":
    → Cortex Search (vector similarity)
elif intent == "forecast_metrics":
    → Cortex ML (time series prediction)
```
**MCP cannot do this** - it only executes SQL queries.

---

**2. Semantic Model Intelligence**
```yaml
# Your semantic.yaml provides business context:
tables:
  - name: VW_SFMC_EMAIL_PERFORMANCE
    description: "Email campaign performance metrics"
    dimensions:
      - name: MARKET
        synonyms: ["country", "region", "geography"]
      - name: CAMPAIGN_TYPE
        values: ["promotional", "transactional", "newsletter"]
```
**Cortex Analyst uses this context** to generate accurate SQL.  
**MCP has no semantic model support** - LLM must guess table/column names.

---

**3. Response Enhancement & Formatting**
```python
# Current flow with full control:
raw_data = analyst.send_message("Show me top campaigns")
# → [{"campaign": "SUMMER_2025", "revenue": 125000}, ...]

enhanced = llm.complete(f"""
Analyze this campaign data and provide:
1. Top 3 performing campaigns
2. Key success factors
3. Actionable recommendations

Data: {raw_data}
""")
# → Beautiful, business-friendly narrative
```
**With MCP:** LLM directly formats SQL results (less control, less consistent).

---

**4. Production Requirements**
```python
# DIA orchestrator includes:
- 🔐 Authentication & authorization
- ⏱️ Rate limiting per user
- 💾 Response caching
- 📊 Custom metrics & monitoring
- 🔄 Retry logic & circuit breakers
- 📝 Structured logging (structlog)
- 🎯 Multiple model support
- 🌍 Multi-tenant support
```
**MCP:** Basic protocol - you'd need to build all this separately.

---

### 🎯 Best of Both Worlds: Hybrid Approach

You can **integrate MCP as an optional client** while keeping your orchestrator:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Client Access Methods               │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Claude Desktop (MCP)         ───┐           │
│  Streamlit Web UI             ───┤           │
│  Mobile App                   ───┼──→ FastAPI Orchestrator
│  REST API Clients             ───┤   ↓
│  Direct HTTP                  ───┘   Cortex Services
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Keep powerful orchestration logic
- ✅ Add MCP for Claude Desktop users
- ✅ Users choose their preferred interface
- ✅ Maintain production features

## 📚 CORTEX SEARCH - Comprehensive Guide

### What It Does
Performs semantic (meaning-based) search using vector embeddings to find similar content.

### Snowflake Function
```sql
-- First, create a Cortex Search Service
CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE campaign_knowledge
    ON content
    WAREHOUSE = COMPUTE_WH
    TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
    AS (
        SELECT content, campaign_name, metadata
        FROM campaign_documents
    );

-- Then search
SELECT * FROM TABLE(
    campaign_knowledge!SEARCH(
        'summer promotion campaigns',
        10  -- Return top 10 results
    )
);
```

### Python Wrapper Methods

#### 1. `search()` - Semantic Search
```python
search_service = CortexSearch(service_name="campaign_knowledge")

results = search_service.search(
    query="email campaigns about seasonal promotions",
    limit=10
)

for result in results.results:
    print(f"Match: {result.content}")
    print(f"Score: {result.score}")  # Similarity: 0.0 to 1.0
    print(f"Rank: {result.rank}")
```

#### 2. `search_with_llm()` - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
```python
# Combines search + LLM for intelligent answers
answer = search_service.search_with_llm(
    query="What are best practices for summer email campaigns?",
    limit=5,
    llm_model="llama3-70b"
)

print(answer)
# Output: "Based on our campaign documents, summer campaigns perform best
# when sent Tuesday-Thursday mornings, with subject lines emphasizing
# limited-time offers and seasonal imagery..."
```

### Practical Use Cases

**Knowledge Base Search:**
```python
# Find relevant documentation
kb_search = CortexSearch(service_name="company_kb")
results = kb_search.search("how to set up email automation")

# Find similar campaigns
campaign_search = CortexSearch(service_name="campaign_history")
results = campaign_search.search("Black Friday 2025")
```

**Customer Support (RAG Pattern):**
```python
# Search knowledge base + generate answer
support = CortexSearch(service_name="support_docs")
answer = support.search_with_llm(
    "How do I improve my email deliverability?",
    limit=3
)
print(answer)  # Gets context from docs, generates natural answer
```

**Content Recommendation:**
```python
# Find similar products/content
content = CortexSearch(service_name="product_catalog")
similar = content.search(
    "women's summer dresses",
    limit=20,
    filters={"category": "apparel", "season": "summer"}
)
```

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Cortex Search Service must be created first in Snowflake
- ✅ Source table with content to search
- ✅ Embeddings automatically generated by Snowflake

**Setup Required:**
```sql
-- Create search service (one-time setup)
CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE my_search_service
    ON content_column
    WAREHOUSE = COMPUTE_WH
    TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
    AS (
        SELECT content_column, metadata_column
        FROM your_table
    );
```

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Requires upfront setup (create search service)
- ❌ Cannot search arbitrary tables (must create service first)
- ❌ Target lag means data isn't instantly searchable

## 🎯 Decision Matrix: Which Service to Use?

### User Ask: "What was revenue last month?"
- ✅ **Use: Cortex Analyst** - Needs real data from database
- ❌ Cortex Complete - Would just make up an answer

### User Ask: "Write me 3 email subject lines"
- ❌ Cortex Analyst - Cannot generate creative content
- ✅ **Use: Cortex Complete** - LLM text generation

### User Ask: "Find campaigns similar to Black Friday 2025"
- ❌ Cortex Analyst - Not designed for similarity search
- ✅ **Use: Cortex Search** - Semantic similarity search

### User Ask: "Predict next week's email volume"
- ❌ Cortex Analyst - Can query historical data but not predict
- ✅ **Use: Cortex ML** - Time series forecasting

### User Ask: "Analyze this data and explain what it means"
- ✅ **Use: Cortex Analyst + Cortex Complete** - Get data, then summarize
- 📝 Pattern: Analyst for data → Complete for explanation

### User Ask: "How do I set up automation?" (from docs)
- ✅ **Use: Cortex Search + Complete (RAG)** - Search docs + generate answer

- [ ] Support fuzzy matching for campaign names

**Example Usage:**
```python
from services.cortex_search import CortexSearch

search = CortexSearch()
results = search.search(
    query="summer campaign",
    service_name="campaign_search",
    top_k=10
)
```

**Test:**
```python
# Test campaign search
results = search.search("newsletter")
assert len(results) > 0
assert results[0].relevance_score > 0.5
```

### 4. Cortex ML Wrapper

**File:** `orchestrator/services/cortex_ml.py`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `CortexML` class
- [ ] Implement `detect_anomalies()` method
- [ ] Implement `forecast()` method
- [ ] Implement `contribution_analysis()` method
- [ ] Handle time series data format

**Example Usage:**
```python
from services.cortex_ml import CortexML

ml = CortexML()

# Anomaly detection
anomalies = ml.detect_anomalies(
    table="VW_SFMC_EMAIL_PERFORMANCE",
    timestamp_col="SEND_DATE",
    metric_col="CLICK_RATE"
)

# Forecasting
forecast = ml.forecast(
    table="VW_SFMC_EMAIL_PERFORMANCE",
    timestamp_col="SEND_DATE",
    target_col="EMAILS_SENT",
    periods=30
)
```

**Test:**
```python
# Test anomaly detection
anomalies = ml.detect_anomalies(sample_data)
assert "anomalies" in anomalies
```

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests

Create test file: `tests/test_cortex_services.py`

```python
import pytest
from orchestrator.services import (
    CortexAnalyst,
    CortexComplete,
    CortexSearch,
    CortexML
)

def test_cortex_analyst():
    analyst = CortexAnalyst()
    result = analyst.send_message("What was click rate last month?")
    assert result is not None

def test_cortex_complete():
    complete = CortexComplete()
    result = complete.complete("What is email marketing?")
    assert len(result) > 0

def test_cortex_search():
    search = CortexSearch()
    results = search.search("campaign")
    assert len(results) >= 0

def test_cortex_ml():
    ml = CortexML()
    # Test with sample data
    pass
```

### Run Tests

```powershell
# Inside Docker container
docker exec dia-orchestrator pytest tests/test_cortex_services.py -v

# Or locally
cd orchestrator
pytest tests/test_cortex_services.py -v
```

---

## Integration with Main App

Update `orchestrator/main.py` to use services:

```python
from services.cortex_analyst import CortexAnalyst
from services.cortex_complete import CortexComplete

analyst = CortexAnalyst()
complete = CortexComplete()

@app.post("/api/v1/query")
async def query(request: QueryRequest):
    # Use Cortex Analyst for SQL generation
    analyst_response = analyst.send_message(request.query)
    
    # Use Cortex Complete for natural language summary
    summary = complete.complete(
        f"Summarize these results: {analyst_response.results}"
    )
    
    return {
        "query": request.query,
        "sql": analyst_response.sql,
        "results": analyst_response.results,
        "summary": summary
    }
```

---

## Deliverables

- [ ] `orchestrator/services/cortex_analyst.py` - Functional with tests
- [ ] `orchestrator/services/cortex_complete.py` - Functional with tests
- [ ] `orchestrator/services/cortex_search.py` - Functional with tests
- [ ] `orchestrator/services/cortex_ml.py` - Functional with tests
- [ ] `tests/test_cortex_services.py` - All tests passing
- [ ] Integration with main FastAPI app
- [ ] Documentation strings added to all methods

---

## Success Criteria

✅ All 4 Cortex services functional with unit tests  
✅ Response format matches Pydantic models  
✅ Error handling implemented  
✅ Logging configured  
✅ Integration tested with sample queries  

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Connection to Snowflake fails
**Solution:** Verify `.env` credentials, check network access

### Issue: Semantic model not found
**Solution:** Ensure Step 1.2 completed, check stage: `LIST @SEMANTIC_MODELS;`

### Issue: Cortex services not available
**Solution:** Verify Cortex services enabled in Snowflake account

---

## Next Steps

After completing this step:
- [ ] Proceed to Step 2.2: Intent Classification
- [ ] Test each service individually
- [ ] Document any API limitations discovered
